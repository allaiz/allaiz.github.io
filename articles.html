  <h2><a href="/articles/contribution-is-key.html">Contribution is Key</a></h2>
  <p>A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> needs a way of determining what share of profit, risk, and control each member has. In a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a>, you would ideally have a share of control that is equal to your relative contribution. The most honest measure of your contribution is the share of profit that other JV members are willing to give you. And the proportion of risk that you bear should be equal to the amount of control you had in deciding what risks were taken. Thus your profit share, risk, and control should all be proportional.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/direct-is-best.html">Direct is Best</a></h2>
  <p>The essence of the control that a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employer</a> has over their business is that it is <em>direct</em>. They do not delegate their decisions to some trusted person who runs the business on their behalf; they do it themselves.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/information-is-everything.html">Information is Everything!</a></h2>
  <p>The biggest difference between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a> and a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employer</a> is having control over your business rather than following orders. But how can you have effective control, unless you also know what is going on?</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/timing-matters.html">Timing Matters</a></h2>
  <p>For any business that has been around for a while, there are two somewhat-distinct groups of people who are responsible for the profit that the business is currently making. The first group are the people who are currently making <strong>new</strong> contributions of time and resources to the business. The second group are people who have <strong>previously</strong> made contributions of time and resources to the business that created ongoing residual value in the business - i.e. the people who built the business up to where it is today, so that the new contributors have something to work with.</p>

  <h2><a href="/articles/apprentice-directors-and-trainee-investors.html">Apprentice Directors and Trainee Investors</a></h2>
  <p>A trainee or apprentice employee is a particularly severe example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">wage slave</a>. They are usually very underpaid, have next to no autonomy or decision making capability in their work, and are subordinate to everyone around them.</p>
