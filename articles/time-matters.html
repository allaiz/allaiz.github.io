      <h2>Time Matters</h2>
<p>For any business that has been around for a while, there are two somewhat-distinct groups of people who are responsible for the profit that the business will make this year. The first group is the people who are currently contributing time and resources to the business. The second group are people who contributed time and resources to the business in the past - the people who built the business up to where it is today, so that the current contributors have something to work with.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Different types of contribution also have a different effect on profit now vs profit in the future. Someone who’s contribution is taking phone orders or making deliveries is probably making most of their contribution towards this month’s profit, while someone who spends months developing a new product, or handles customer complaints, is probably contributing more to profit in future years.</p>
