      <h2>Contribution is Key</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> needs a way of determining what share of profit, risk, and control each member has. In a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a>, each member should ideally have a share of control and risk that is equal to their particular share of profit.
<!--more--></p>

<h4 id="goal-congruence">Goal congruence</h4>

<p>The first reason for this is <a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/9/goal-congruence">Goal Congruence</a>. Goal congruence means everyone on the team having the same objective - they want the same thing and are motivated to work for the same goal. This is most likely to occur when the <em>incentives</em> for each team member are the same.</p>

<p>For example if some JV members get a share of profit that is relatively greater than their share of risk, then they will have an incentive for the JV to pursue more risky business opportunities, while the other members who are entitled to more risk than profit have an incentive for the JV to do the opposite. This can lead to conflict and a lack of cooperation, and reduce the overall effectiveness of the JV. An example of this would occur whenever some JV members are promised a fixed amount of income from the JV; because their income would not vary at the same rate as other members when the profit increased or decreased, they would have divergent incentives from other team members. This would encourage them to prefer different business decisions to the other JV members, which would tend to create friction between them.</p>

<h4 id="contribution">Contribution</h4>

<p>The second reason for this is because the share of profit that a JV member’s colleagues are willing to give them, is also the best measure of the relative value of that JV member’s <em>contribution</em>, at least according to their colleagues. And the amount of contribution that a member makes to the JV is the fairest measure of how much of the JV is really “theirs” - and by extension, what their proportion of control over the JV should be, and how much of the JV’s risk they should bear.</p>

<h4 id="no-room-for-salaries-or-wages---only-profits-and-losses">No room for salaries or wages - only profits and losses</h4>

<p>Being self employed means having control over your business, and bearing all the reward and risks that come from it.</p>

<p>In the same way then, contributing to a Self Employment Joint Venture should mean that you have control over the JV in proportion to your contribution, and that you should also bear an equivalent proportion of it’s reward and risk. And what’s not included in that is any sort of fixed-amount claim on the profits of the venture, or any sort of salary or wage.</p>

<p>Fixed prices should be for your customers… not your colleagues. You should share the fortunes of the business together.</p>
