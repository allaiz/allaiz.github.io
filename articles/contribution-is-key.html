          <h2>Contribution is Key</h2>
<p>Your share of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture’s</a> profit should be equal to the share of total contributions to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> that were made by you, rather than by someone else.</p>

<p>When you negotiate your share of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> profits with your colleagues, you are in effect collectively agreeing how valuable your contributions are, relative to everyone else’s contributions.</p>

<!--more-->

<img src="/articles/images/contribution.jpg" class="d-lg-none mx-auto" style="max-width: 100%" /></p>

<p>The relative amount of control that you have over the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> should also be the same as your relative contribution. That means it’s also the same as your relative profit share, since contribution and profit share should be the same too.</p>

<p>And finally, if the business doesn’t succeed, you stand to lose whatever you have contributed.</p>

<p>So therefore your relative contribution, relative profit share, and relative risk in case of business failure should all be the same.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="no-room-for-salaries-or-wages-only-profits-and-losses">No room for salaries or wages, only profits and losses</h4>

<p>If everyone’s share of profit and risk is equal to their contribution, then there will be no leftover amounts that could go towards giving anyone a fixed salary or wage.</p>

<p>And this makes sense.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/images/climber.jpg" class="d-none d-lg-block mx-auto" style="max-width: 100%" />
<img src="/articles/images/climber.jpg" class="d-lg-none mx-auto" style="max-width: 100%" /></p>

<p>Being self employed means having control over your business, and bearing all the reward and risks that come from it.</p>

<p>In the same way then, contributing to a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> should mean that you have control over the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a>, and have a portion of it’s risks and rewards, exactly to the extent that it is <strong><em>yours</em></strong>; the extent to which it exists because of your contributions.</p>

<p>Fixed prices should be for your customers, not your colleagues. You should share the fortunes of the business together.</p>

<h4 id="goal-congruence">Goal congruence</h4>

<p>Another big advantage of keeping things proportional is <a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/9/goal-congruence">Goal Congruence</a>. Goal congruence means everyone on the team having the same objective - they want the same thing and are motivated to work for the same goal, and the team performs better as a result.</p>

<p>It’s a performance enhancing competitive advantage.</p>

<img src="/articles/images/rowers.jpg" class="d-lg-none mx-auto" style="max-width: 100%" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/9/goal-congruence">Goal Congruence</a> is most likely to occur when the <em>incentives</em> for each team member are the same - which is exactly what you get when risk, reward, and control are proportional.</p>
