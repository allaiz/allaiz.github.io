      <h2>Information is Everything!</h2>
<p>The biggest difference between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a> and a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employer</a> is having control over your business rather than following orders. But how can you have effective control, unless you also know what is going on?
<!--more--></p>

<h4 id="its-your-information">It’s <strong><em>your</em></strong> information</h4>

<p>When you are a Self Employer, you make every decision in your business and conduct all communication on it’s behalf. This means that you know every bit of information that belongs to the business, and use that information whenever you make decisions about what your business should do.</p>

<p>A company that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">employs Wage Slaves</a> needs to explicitly capture all of the company’s information in a form that makes it accessible to the company’s decision makers, rather than just to the individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery">employee</a> who communicated with a customer or supplier or who made a particular decision. Invoices, purchase orders, and inventory are recorded in databases. Customer call centers keep recordings of phone conversations. I.T. departments have access to every email sent by every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery">employee</a>, and make them available on request to management, since the contents are supposed to be company business. Financial transactions are recorded in bank statements and ledgers, and salaries, wages, and other entitlements of employees are recorded by H.R. departments. All of it is available in summarized or detailed form to senior management at any time they feel they need it to make a decision.</p>

<p>Every member of a Self Employment Joint Venture is an owner of the JV, and needs to make decisions about what it should do. Although you share the JV with other members, it is still very much “your” business. And you have a right to know everything about it, so that you can exercise your control over it effectively. This means that your fellow Joint Venturers have a responsibility to provide you with access to any information about the JV that they are in possession of, in a way that makes it feasible for you to actually use it (it’s not much good if they write things down for you, but it’s on paper in a shoebox in someone’s basement in another city!)</p>

<p>For a Self Employment Joint Venture to deliver the experience of working for yourself while working with others, your fellow Joint Venturers must be obligated to take minutes of meetings, logs or recordings of phone calls, keep records of agreements with customers and suppliers, and record income and expenditures, and make all of it easily accessible to you, which probably means some kind of shared on-line repository, even if it’s just a group email thread.</p>
