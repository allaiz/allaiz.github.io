      <h2>Timing Matters</h2>
<p>For any business that has been around for a while, there are two somewhat-distinct groups of people who are responsible for the profit that the business is currently making. The first group are the people who are currently making <strong>new</strong> contributions of time and resources to the business. The second group are people who have <strong>previously</strong> made contributions of time and resources to the business that created ongoing residual value in the business - i.e. the people who built the business up to where it is today, so that the new contributors have something to work with.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The ownership structure of a Self Employment Joint Venture should reflect that there are <strong>new</strong> and <strong>previous</strong> contributions that are working together to create profit. If 30% of current and expected future profits are attributable to <strong>new</strong> contributions, then because <a href="/articles/contribution-is-key.html">contribution is key</a>, 30% of the control of the company and of profit share should go to the people currently making those <strong>new</strong> contributions.</p>

<p>As well as this difference between <strong>new</strong> vs <strong>previous</strong> contributions, there is also a difference between contributions that create <strong>immediate</strong> profit vs contributions that create <strong>deferred</strong> (in the future) profit. Someone who’s contribution is taking phone orders or making deliveries is probably making most of their contribution towards this month’s (<strong>immediate</strong>) profit, while someone who spends months developing a new product, or handles customer complaints, may contributing more to (<strong>deferred</strong>) profit in future years.</p>

<p>The entitlements that a new contribution receives should reflect how much <strong>immediate</strong> vs <strong>deferred</strong> profit the contribution is expected to make, and there are many ways that this could be done. One obvious way would be to set up a joint venture company with <a href="#1">two classes of shares <sup>(see footnote 1)</sup></a>, temporary shares and permanent shares. Permanent class shares represent contribution towards deferred profit, and can be held long term. Temporary class shares represent contribution to immediate profit, and expire and are revoked as soon as that person stops contributing, or at a fixed date in the future when the proportions of profit share are to be re-negotiated.</p>

<p>Regular re-negotiation is important because the amount of residual value in the business (i.e. the amount of <strong>previous</strong> contribution that is still valuable) changes over time, as does the proportion of your contribution that creates <strong>immediate</strong> vs <strong>deferred</strong> profit. You should regularly re-negotiate of how much profit should go to <strong>new</strong> vs <strong>previous</strong> contributions, as well as how much of your contribution should be considered to create <strong>immediate</strong> vs <strong>deferred</strong> profit. Setting an expiry date for temporary shares would be one way to achieve this.

<p><em id="1">footnote 1: In circumstances where having multiple share classes is onerous or impossible, such as needing a U.S.A. “S” corporation to avoid double taxation, a very similar effect could be achieved by only issuing one class of “permanent” shares, and using some kind of “contribution contract” to establish voting rights and profit share entitlements for contributions that create <strong>immediate</strong> profit. This may or may not push you towards a two layer hybrid incorporated-plus-unincorporated JV structure - I think it would be best consult a lawyer about this sort of thing!
