      <h2>Direct is Best</h2>
<p>The essence of the control that a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employer</a> has over their business is that it is <em>direct</em>. They do not delegate their decisions to some trusted person who runs the business on their behalf; they do it themselves.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Preserving this aspect of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employment</a> in a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> requires that, to the greatest extent practical, every memberâ€™s control over the JV should be <em>direct</em>, rather than <em>representative</em>. Every member should vote directly on every significant decision that affects the business, rather than merely voting for a Director or CEO who <em>represents</em> them and makes decisions for them. Only trivial or repetitive decisions should be handed off to individual JV members to make on behalf of everyone else. The most important decisions about the JV, such as adding new members or expelling existing members, or entering into contracts with external parties, should probably require unanimous agreement of all members.</p>

<p>This obviously creates a lot of voting. In centuries past, coordinating a vote was difficult and time consuming, and this was a major driver for using hierarchical representative governance structures with multiple layers of management and poor to non-existent oversight of executives. Now that we all carry networked supercomputers in our pockets 24/7, coordinating a vote can be trivial, even in response to emergencies. This change is the main reason why <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Ventures</a> are now a much more practical, responsive, and scalable business structure than they have been in the past.</p>
