          <h2>Rule Number One</h2>
<p>Rule Number One of any <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> must be that the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">must not have any Employees</a></em></strong>, and must not subject anyone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slavery</a> in any other way. Otherwise, it’s not a real <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a>, it’s just a boring old everyday <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">joint venture</a>.</p>

<h4 id="remember-what-its-all-about">Remember what it’s all about</h4>

<p>You seek <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employment</a> because you are self aware enough to understand how bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slavery</a> is for you. And you choose to join a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> because you don’t want to work by yourself forever, and you are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Silver_Rule">ethical and empathic enough</a> to not subject anyone else to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slavery</a> you yourself are trying to escape.</p>

<p>This prohibition against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slavery</a> is so fundamental to the nature of a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> that it must be explicitly stated in the contract that establishes the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a>. Failing to abide by that clause of the contract would be to betray the trust of all the other members of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a>, and to negate the purpose of their efforts in setting up and running a <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a> in the first place.</p>

<p>That should be considered a fundamental breach of the contract, and the contract should provide for penalties up to and including expulsion from the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> and the return of earnings or profits that have been received from it.</p>

<p>To ensure the clause can be effectively enforced, each member should have authority under the contract to act unilaterally, on behalf of and as agent for the <a href="/">Self Employment Joint Venture</a>, to apply those penalties to the member who is in breach of the contract. Each member should also unilaterally have standing under the contract to sue to enforce those penalty clauses in any court that has jurisdiction over the contract.</p>
