          <h2>Job seeking? Well if you want something done right...</h2>
<p>…do it yourself. There are hundreds of applicants for every job right now. So don’t wait for someone to employ you. Employ yourself instead.</p>

<p>You have skills, talent, and experience. You have (some) ideas and (some) resources. All you need is a team; some talent to help so you can be competitive. And right now there is so much talent unemployed, that it’s as if there were diamonds lying in the street.</p>

<p>And you need to work with that talent in a business structure that can ride out these tough conditions without being bankrupted by overheads. Setting up a Self Employer Alliance could help you attract top-notch collaborators to launch a business, while eliminating fixed wage expenses that could sink a new business trying to get established in this market.</p>

<p>That might be your fastest way out of unemployment, and leave you in a better position than you were in when this all started.</p>

<p>Come over to r/allaiz and join in the “help wanted” discussion, and us all know what type of business you would like to set up or to join!</p>
