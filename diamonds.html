      <h2>There are Diamonds lying in the street</h2>
<p>In normal times, the very best people in any profession are almost never looking for a job. Trying to find them and recruit them into a business is like prospecting for diamonds.</p>

<p>But with the massive economic dislocation and contraction that is occurring, there is top talent that has become unemployed and is finding out that there are just no other work for them to transition into. For anyone searching for talent, it’s like there are diamonds just lying in the street to be picked up by anyone who wants them!</p>

<p>If you have ever wanted to be in business for yourself and you have a business idea to get started on, then now is the ideal time to scoop up as much of this talent to help you as you can… and if you set up a Self Employment Joint Venture to invite them into, then you can recruit all that talent for free.</p>

<p>Why a Self Employment Joint Venture? Well if you wanted to hire people as Wage Slaves, then presumably you are already out there hiring like crazy. But you are here reading this instead.</p>

<p>Which means that either you can’t hire employees, because of lack of money, or you don’t want to hire employees, because you understand that they, just like you, are better off working for themselves and you would rather have colleagues than servants.</p>

<p>Hopefully you are still here for the latter reason.</p>

<p>In which case, come on over to r/allaiz and let’s start putting together some Self Employer Alliances! Join in the help wanted thread, and let everyone know about the Alliance you would like them to join.</p>
