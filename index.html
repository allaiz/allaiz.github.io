<p>…this means being <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employed</a>, and having a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> with other people who are Self Employed.</p>

<p>Being “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employed</a>” means having your own business but not having any employees. You are the business - you’re a one person show.</p>

<p>A “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a>”, or “JV” is when separate businesses work together on something, because they can do that thing more easily together.</p>

<p>A Self Employment Joint Venture (or SEJV) is a special type of JV that is for Self Employers only, based on a contract that requires everyone working for the JV to be Self Employed. This allows the JV to conduct business without requiring anyone to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a>. It helps each JV member work for themselves, together with others.</p>

<p><br />
Allaiz.com is a place to build alliances (SEJVs) with other self employers, so you can profitably and happily work for yourselves together.</p>

<p>My name is John, and I am thoroughly sick of being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a>.<br />
I would like to work in a self employer alliance instead.<br />
I would like to find other people who would like to do this too.<br />
I would like to be part of an on-line community that can help us start and run Self Employment JVs together.</p>

<p>I am currently working to make Allaiz.com into a “help wanted” board for would-be self employers who would like to join an alliance, as well as a repository of links and on-line tools for setting up and running those SEJV alliances.</p>

<p>I will be recording my progress in the Allaiz.com blog, and I have also set up a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/allaiz">subreddit</a> at r/allaiz where we can meet and organize self employment alliances in the mean time.</p>

<p>So if you think that you might like to start or join an alliance too, then come on over and say hi <a href="https://reddit.com/r/allaiz">here</a>! :-)</p>
