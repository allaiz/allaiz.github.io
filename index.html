<p>This means being <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employed</a>, and having a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a> with other people who are Self Employed.</p>

<p>Being “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp">Self Employed</a>” means having your own business but not having any employees. You are the business - you’re a one person show. Self Employed people often have their own company or other corporate structure that they conduct business through (sometimes referred to as being <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/self-incorporated-meaning">Self Incorporated</a>), but they are usually the only shareholder and director of the company too.</p>

<p>A “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp">Joint Venture</a>”, or “JV” is formed when a number of different businesses (usually companies) get together to work on a particular project that they can more easily do together than separately. Usually this is because the different JV members have different skills or resources that are complimentary, and by combining them they can take advantage of business opportunities they would not have on their own.</p>

<p>Joint Ventures are created by making a contract between the members that sets out what each member agrees to do, how the JV business will be run, and how profits, expenses, and risks will be distributed between the different members. This contract is called a Joint Venture Agreement, or JVA for short.</p>

<p>A Self Employment Joint Venture (or SEJV) exists when a Joint Venture Agreement requires that all the members of the JV be Self Employed, rather than businesses that have employees. This allows the business to operate without requiring anyone to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a>. For this to work properly, the JVA should also require that any Subsidiaries of the JV and any other businesses that the JV controls or invests in should not have employees either.</p>

<h2 id="allaiz">Allaiz</h2>

<p>My name is John, and I am thoroughly sick of being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery#Similarities_of_wage_work_with_slavery">Wage Slave</a>.<br />
I would like to work in a Self Employment Joint Venture instead.<br />
I would like to find other people who would like to do this too.<br />
I would like to be part of an on-line community that can help us start and run Self Employment JVs together.</p>

<p>I am currently working to make Allaiz.com into a meeting place for individuals who would like to be part of an SEJV, as well as a repository of on-line tools for setting up and running SEJVs.</p>

<p>I will be recording my progress in the Allaiz.com blog, and I have also set up a <a href="https://reddit.com/r/allaiz">subreddit</a> at r/allaiz where we can meet and discuss STJVs in the mean time, so if you think that a STJV might interest you, then come on over and say hi <a href="https://reddit.com/r/allaiz">here</a>! :-)</p>
